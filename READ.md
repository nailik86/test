Hundreds of meters away…
Wolf Head put down his binoculars as a glint of vigilance flashed from his eyes. He could tell that Tang Xiu had realized something but was unsure if he himself had been found or not. Cautiously, he quickly circled to the other side of the park and quietly approached
A few minutes later…
Wolf Head appeared in the grove. As though a shadow in the dark, he quietly arrived at the wall where Tang Xiu was moments before. As he squatted on the ground, he quickly observed the footprints on the ground. It seemed to be heading to another direction.
“Huh? It’s gone?”
He lost Tang Xiu’s footprints under a tree. Just as he turned to search again, his complexion greatly changed as he suddenly dashed to bolt away.
Whoosh…
A figure fell from above in front of him.
With a cold and detached expression, Tang Xiu looked at Wolf Head. Even though he had a gun strapped on his waist, he didn’t have the intention use it. To him, his own martial strength was his biggest tool for killing.
“Following me all the way here was quite hard, wasn’t it?”
Wolf Head instantly retreated a few meters back. But he didn’t turn around to run away, instead, he stared at Tang Xiu as though a hungry wolf as he said with a sinking tone, “Only a few people are able to track me back in the entire world. I don’t know how you were able to find me!”
“Someone who has experienced many life and death situations will develop a particularly keen sense of danger. The murderous intent within you is very heavy, which says that the number of people who have died in your hands was at least 100. Judging from your reaction when you observed the footprints and retreated back at the same time, I can tell that you’re also someone who has been walking on the path of death.” Tang Xiu said apathetically.
“I’ve investigated you. You’re just an ordinary student from the information I’ve gotten. Even if you have some powerful aspects compared to others, you just graduated from high school and have just started your own business. But, I can’t fathom your skills as well as how you can kill without even batting an eye. I’ll never believe that someone is born with such great strength nor I believe that one could have such inborn cold-blooded disposition. Can you explain this to me?” Puzzled, Wolf Head replied.
“You’re not qualified.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said.
Wolf Head squinted his eyes. His body tightened instantly as he spoke with a sinking tone, “Regardless of if I have the qualification or not, it’s still unbeknownst to us. If you can win me, I’ll consider agreeing with your condition.”
_My condition?_
Tang Xiu was surprised and distracted for a moment.
At this moment, Wolf Head suddenly moved as his fist flew at him. As he lifted his arms, his fist flew, creating sharp and whooshing sounds of wind and instantly smashed at Tang Xiu’s face. His speed already surpassed that of a human’s- even Tang Xiu himself dared not to take it lightly.

“Go back!”
However, Tang Xiu’s speed also some points faster than him. Using his fist to meet head-on with Wolf Head’s, his body shook, but it didn’t push him back, whereas Wolf Head stepped back for 7-8 steps. Only after retreating staggeringly was he able to stabilize his body.
“What a strength!”
Wolf Head’s right hand was trembling as he looked at Tang Xiu with disbelief and exclaimed in astonishment.
“Your strength is also quite powerful. I didn’t expect yours also exceed a thousand pounds. If my guess is right, you should be a Qigong practitioner, right? In addition, you also have cultivated your True Qi and reached the Small Accomplishment level. Even those so-called martial arts grandmasters could die within a short time if they were to have a life-and-death fight with you.
Wolf Head admittedly smiled. His body dashed again toward Tang Xiu. And this time, he was still waving his fist as before and punched at Tang Xiu’s face. However, his footwork and stance were different from before. The moment his fist was about to hit Tang Xiu, he instantly rotated his footwork and changed into a peculiar direction as his punch swung toward Tang Xiu’s left next in a strange trajectory.
"Hmph…"
Tang Xiu coldly snorted, his hands moved lightning fast and instantly blocked Wolf Head’s strike. Either close combat fight or fighting experience, he was thousand times stronger than Wolf Head, for he had experienced countless battles. The neurons and nerves all over his body had all entered a combat state.
Along with the retracting movement of his footwork, Wolf Head tried to strike again, but ultimately could resist no longer. He had no choice but to go all out to withstand and dodge Tang Xiu’s attack.
"Bang…"
Wolf Head’s arms were dislocated with Tang Xiu’s Shadow Kick. He paled as an acute burning pain assaulted him as he staggeringly moved backward and shouted loudly, “Stop!”
Tang Xiu stopped attacking. He stood about 4-5 meters away from him as he said indifferently, “You still have your Mitsubishi army knife no? Why don’t you use it and then talk?”
Wolf Head forced out a smile and shook his head with a sigh, “Wang Ming said that you’re very strong and he had no chance to even fight back. He was trained personally by me, so I know what he’s capable of. I didn’t believe him at first, but now I have to admit that you’re very strong. My arms are dislocated, I’m not able to fight anymore.”
“So, you’re the Wolf Head?” Tang Xiu asked with knitted brows.
“Yes!” Wolf Head replied with a wry smile.
“Very punctual you’re for coming to Star City within the three days deadline. I want to ask you. Are you related with those assassins?” Tang Xiu relaxed his nerves and asked.
“No. After we investigated you, we discovered that you were also under the surveillance of another group. Those people are clearly well-trained assassins, two of them were not even from our country. We’ve investigated about them. They came from abroad with the sole purpose of killing you.” Wolf Head shook his head and replied.
“So, your intention was to use them to test my strength, yes?” Tang Xiu said.
“I did. If you can’t even solve this hurdle, what qualifications do you have to become our superior?” Wolf Head admitted and said.
“Then, what do you think after you’ve personally experienced my strength?” Tang Xiu nodded and said.
“I only have one request. If you can find the mastermind behind this and thoroughly solve this problem, our team will work under you.” Said Wolf Head.
“So be it!” Tang Xiu said.
“However, I ought to tell you beforehand. We might bring some troubles once we join you. We have quite particular identities, and it’s very difficult for average people to face us, so we’re also under surveillance- some people started spying on us the moment we came to Star City. We too have the intention to shake off these people and quietly finish them off.” Wolf Head replied with hesitation.
“People from the state?” Tang Xiu’s brow pricked and inquired further.
“Yes, special task force.” Wolf Head nodded and said.
“No problem for me. You all have already been stripped off from your previous identities. Besides, your assignment won’t be in the mainland.” Tang Xiu said.
“We’ll go abroad?” Wolf Head asked with a surprised expression.
“Yes. I’ve bought a private island in the Pacific Ocean. And I need some people to protect the fort there. You have sufficient strength and should be capable enough of keeping the security there.” Tang Xiu said.
With a surprised expression, Wolf Head looked at Tang Xiu and said with a low voice, “Are you going to create your own private armed forces?”
"Yes!" Tang Xiu nodded with a deadpan expression.
“It’s fine with us! This is our specialty to begin with. But, can you tell me what kind of treatment you’ll give us?”
“It depends on the type of relation you’ll have with me! If you truly become my people, and if you can become a death squad hell-bent on following my orders, whatever it is, naturally, you’ll have the best treatment you can think of. You can be sure to even have your dreams come true. But it’s also fine if you want to become one of the ordinary ranks under me. You’ll have good treatment, but surely, with some disparities with the previous ones.” Tang Xiu said lightly.
“You’re very ambitious, it seems. Your condition and your ambition kinda makes me scared.” Wolf Head replied with a deep tone as he looked at Tang Xiu deeply.
Tang Xiu replied with a sneer, “If that’s not enough for you, then, when you’re able to destroy this planet with only one punch, nobody will be able to threaten you by then.”
Wolf Head couldn’t help but shake his head and smile.
Destroying Earth with only one fist? What was this? A damn joke? If one is able to destroy the Earth with only a punch, isn’t he able to traverse the universe freely?
After chiding him inside a few times, he looked at Tang Xiu and said, “For now, what kind of troops we want to be is not important, for you must first prove your strength before we talk again.”
“Well, just wait for the show.” Tang Xiu turned around and walked toward the park’s fence.
Half an hour later…
Inside a building a kilometer away from South Gate Town. The door was knocked gently seven times in a rhythmic sound. After that, the door was opened from the inside.
Inside the room...
Wang Ming was still with the binoculars in his hand as he looked at Wolf Head, who was coming inside with a pale face, and then asked with a surprised expression, “What happened to you, Chief?”
“I just exchanged some blows with Tang Xiu. You did say the truth, he’s truly powerful. The one and only expert I’ve never seen in my life. Alright, help me fix my dislocated arms now!” Under the gaze of the five men inside the room, Wolf Head said with a bitter and astringent smile.
The rest of the men inside the room were greatly taken aback. They looked at Wolf Head’s dislocated arms with disbelief, and their heartbeat sped up as well as palpitated. Wolf Head was the strongest amongst them, but he was also unable to contend with Tang Xiu- even have his arms were dislocated by him. Then, to what extent Tang Xiu’s strength reached?
At present…
Amongst them, perhaps only Wang Ming knew Tang Xiu’s strength. He forced out a bitter smile and quickly helped Wolf Head connect his arms’ bones and said, “Actually, I’ve already guessed that Chief Wolf isn’t Tang Xiu’s opponent. That fellow’s speed, strength and reaction speed can only be called as terrifying. Even if I go all out I’m still unable to touch his sleeves.”
“He’s very strong!” Wolf Head said.
With hesitation, Wang Ming asked, “Chief Wolf, what have you discussed with him?”
“I’ve explicitly told him that if he can completely solve this problem and prove his strength, then we’ll follow him later. If he can’t, then it’s not worth it for us to do so. Also, he told me that we won’t stay in the mainland once we work under him.” Wolf Head replied.
“Uh, we won’t stay in the mainland? Where will we go then?” Wang Ming asked with a confused expression.
“He said that the he had bought a private island in the Pacific Ocean, so he wants us to keep the security of the island. He wants to set up his own private army.” Wolf Head said.
“Private armed force? What is he planning to do?” Wang Ming asked in wonder.
Wolf Head shook his head and said, “I don’t know about it either.”


Tang Xiu quietly went back to South Gate Town and didn’t disturb anyone. As he went to his room, he immediately took his mobile and dialed Miao Wentang’s number.
“You haven’t slept, Brother Tang?”
Miao Wentang’s cheerful laughter came out of the phone.
“Not yet. I need to talk to you about something.” Tang Xiu said.
“What’s up? Tell me!” Miao Wentang replied.
“Are you short on money right now? And do you want to get your hands on some?” Tang Xiu asked.
“I do. Never been like this before. But anyway, what kind of good business are you offering me?” Miao Wentang replied with a light laugh.
Tang Xiu said, “I’m preparing to pull out the roots of my personal enemy. I have contacted some people and am now preparing to act in the next few days. Do you have any interest in joining?”
“Which family?” Miao Wentang asked.
“The Zhangs, Star City.” Tang Xiu said.
Miao Wentang was silent for a moment before he slowly spoke, “Never heard of this family. It should be a big, respected family in the country. But regardless of any family, since Brother Tang has openly spoken about it, naturally, I’ll join the fray. By the way, do you want me to call Brother Shao also?”
“I’ll call him myself. If you want to join, then come to Star City tomorrow, we’ll meet in the Long’s Dining Hall.” Tang Xiu said.
"Alright!"
After Tang Xiu hung up, he dialed Shao Mingzhen’s number, and just like Miao Wentang, he also agreed to join.
“Now, the Ouyang Family!”
Tang Xiu paused. He was somewhat hesitating. His plan to remove the Zhang Family was definitely a big move. Even though he had invited four forces consisting of the Long Family, Chen Zhizhong, Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen to join this endeavor, but the Zhang Family was a local tyrant in Star City and had deep roots here, so they might still be able to counterattack before dying. He could tell that their resistance before death would be very powerful. He was hesitating whether to pull the Ouyang Family in this, as he would then owe them a favor.
Owing money was still okay, but owing a favor of gratitude was very difficult to repay. As reluctant as he always was to have it, Tang Xiu didn’t want to owe any gratitude from others.
Finally, he decided to talk with Ouyang Lulu first in order to sound out this problem.
Tang Xiu looked through the window, watching the white Land Rover in the parking lot. Then, he turned around to leave his room. As he arrived at the guest room where Ouyang Lulu was staying, he knocked the door.
"Click..."
The door was opened from the inside as Ouyang Lulu, in her sexy pajamas, stood at the door with sleepy-watery eyes. She muttered out of discontent and said, “What do you want from me in the middle of the night? This young lady came to your home and is only spending the night here temporarily, I won’t give up my chastity for you!”
Tang Xiu passed by her toward the sofa. As he sat down, he said, “I need to talk to you about something important. Wash your face first to sober up!"

Ouyang Lulu rolled her eyes at him as she went to the bathroom to wash her face. She came back more spirited afterward, even though there was still a trace of dissatisfaction on her face. She then snorted and said, “What is this serious business that you can’t even wait until tomorrow? Don’t you see what time it is now?”
Tang Xiu replied with a straightforward manner, “The deal is big, are you interested?”
Ouyang Lulu confused, "What big deal?"
“To tell you the truth, it’s not a serious business, but you can be sure that it will bring you money. Some people from a certain family in Star City have crossed my line and I’m preparing to remove them. This family is very rich and powerful. I’ve already contacted some people and will act in the next few days. Even though your Ouyang Family isn’t based in Star City, you have deep capital. So, if you want the share of this endeavor, I can let you join on this.”
Ouyang Lulu asked curiously, "Which family?"
Tang Xiu lightly said, “It’s the Zhangs.”
“Zhengyu told me that his family has some friction with this Zhang Family. The people you’ve contacted should also include the Long family, shouldn’t it?” Ouyang Lulu said.
Tang Xiu replied with a nod, “Yes. If the Zhang Family is to be completely destroyed, the Long Family will have the biggest benefits. This is a heaven-sent opportunity. If Long Hanwen and Chen Zhizhong are not stupid, I’m sure they will join.”
Ouyang Lulu pondered for a moment. As she sat at the opposite side from Tang Xiu, she asked, “Can you tell me as how the Zhangs have offended you?”
“I once gave a lesson to the Zhang’s arrogant princess, Zhang Deqin. I also taught their young master twice before. And yesterday, when I brought Yinyin outside to buy some books in the bookstore, I was being spied on by three assassins. Even though I’ve killed those three assassins, but I also have spent quite a lot of money to find out that Zhang Deqin is behind this. You tell me. She wants me die. Should I not kill them also?” Tang Xiu said with a tranquil expression.
Ouyang Lulu was surprised, “You’re the one who killed those three people at the front entrance of South Gate Town today? Those three were actually assassins? Ah right, I heard that there were firearms found at the scene, so it turns out that those people are the evil kind. But this is kinda a big issue, so I have to discuss this with my family.”
“If your family join in, then we’ll meet tomorrow night at the Long’s Dining Hall with the others.” Tang Xiu said.
“You haven’t told me who are the others who’ll join aside from the Long Family.” Ouyang Lulu said.
“It the Longs, Chen Zhizhong and my other two friends. They have their own forces, but I don’t know about their strength in detail.” Answered Tang Xiu.
“You didn’t invite Chu Yi and Bai Tao?” Ouyang Lulu asked with surprise.
“No, their family in Beijing perhaps have their own hostile adversaries, so I don’t want them to participate in this.” Tang Xiu said.
Since Ouyang Lulu herself was the eldest daughter of an affluent family, she was also well aware about this problem as she nodded and said, “I know. The Chu and Bai Families are very close, but they too have some respected families that pose a threat to them. If their actions catch the attention of their enemies, perhaps they will also face some big troubles.”
At Jianning District, Star City.
Inside a three-storied building, Zhang Deqin was sitting on the soft sofa with a cup of red wine in her hand. However, there remained more than a half of it. Her expression was unsightly as anxiousness and worry could be seen on her face. In front of her, Zhang Yongjin was walking back and forth restlessly whilst glancing from time to time at Zhang Deqin’s mobile.
They were waiting for news about the removal of their enemy.
However, even after late in the night, there was not even the slightest bit of news.
“Can you just calm down? If you can’t stomach it, just go sleep! I’ll handle everything myself!” Zhang Deqin snapped with an irritated expression.
Zhang Yongjin stopped, then sat opposite her. He took a cigarette, lit it and puffed a few mouthfuls as he spoke, “Big Sis, could it be something happened? It’s already the middle of the night, but how come there’s not even a bit of news at all? These assassins you’ve hired, aren’t they very good?”
“You ask me, but who should I ask?” Zhang Deqin replied angrily.
“The murders in front of the entrance of South Gate Town, could it be related with that surnamed Tang? I heard that three people died there, maybe there’s someone named Tang, his friends or relatives?” Zhang Yongjin hesitated as he said.
Zhang Deqin herself had heard the news, but she was unsure as who the victims were. She had spent 20 million to hire assassins from the Philippines. The other party only told her that they would do the job but didn’t say as to how many they would send.
What made her restless was not Tang Xiu getting killed. She was worried that the middleman would sell her if the assassins were killed. If Tang Xiu didn’t die and he figured out that she was the one who hired them, her fate would definitely be very miserable.
"Ring… ring… ring…”
Her mobile sounded, shocking the siblings.
Zhang Deqin quickly grabbed it and immediately pressed the answer button upon seeing the caller ID. She then asked with a sinking tone, “Have you clearly investigated the three people who were killed in front of South Gate Town’s entrance?”
“Their identities are unidentified. But they are not from our country.”
A low and deep voice came out of the phone.
The phone was hung up!
The phone was dropped from Zhang Deqin’s hand, but it was as though she didn’t realize it. If these three killed people were not domestic, then they should be the assassins she had hired.
But they… wouldn’t sell her out, would they?”
No! They shouldn’t be!
The one she contacted were not them, but a middleman. As long as the middleman didn’t sell her out, she would be absolutely safe.
She quickly picked the mobile back and dialed the middleman’s number. However, she was at a complete loss and restless as the other party unexpectedly shut his phone down.
What was happening exactly?
Zhang Deqin looked at Zhang Yongjn’s eyes with a restless expression. A few minutes later, she suddenly stood and quickly spoke to him, “Leave Star City tonight. Do remember that, even if something huge happens here, you mustn’t come back to Star City for a short while. You must go to…. Northern Jiangsu. I have a friend there, she’ll take care of you for a while.”
“Big Sis, what’s happened exactly? We’re the one who hired the assassins, but why do I feel that we’re the ones being targeted?”
“I have a bad premonition that this will create a big trouble. Look, don’t think and don’t ask. Leave Star City tonight and go to my friend’s in Northern Jiangsu. Pack up your things and prepare, NOW!” Zhang Deqin replied with a bitter expression.
“But Sis, how about you?” Zhang Yongjin hurriedly asked.
“I can’t go anywhere. Firstly, we aren’t sure whether Tang Xiu has figured out that we’re the masterminds. Secondly, our family has our own shelter here, so I’ll be alright. Also, I will try to appear amidst the public in the next few days with more bodyguards around me. Thirdly, even if Tang Xiu knows that I’m the one who hired those assassins, he won’t be so brazen and reckless as to act against me, for he’s also well aware that our Zhang Family will absolutely retaliate without mercy.”
“No, Sis! I don’t wanna go. If Tang Xiu can’t do nothing to you, then he also won’t dare strike me! Going or staying, we must stay together!” Zhang Yongjin replied.
Zhang Deqin felt warm inside, but she still shouted angrily, “Cut the crap. I said you must go tonight. I’ll tell Dad and Mom about this.”
“NO! I don’t need you to tell me what to do. And don’t threaten me! I’m a man. I must stay here!” Zhang Yongjin talked back angrily.
“You want me to tie you up and send you there, or do you want go there obediently yourself? Choose!” Zhang Deqin replied with a sneer.


Star City, Police Department, Criminal Division.
The entire building of the Criminal Division’s offices was still brightly lit even though morning had already come. A lot of police officers were passing in and out of the building, while police cars also came and left with their flashing lights on.
On the second floor of the building.
The office was filled with curling smoke, the pungent smell irritating people’s noses. Deng Jianmin—the director of the City Public Security Bureau, clamped his cigarettes and deeply frowned as he looked at more than 20 police officers of the Criminal Division.
“Our superiors have decreed that we must solve this case within three days. I don’t care what methods, get me the murderer as soon as possible!” Deng Jianmin spoke with an unsightly expression.
Cheng Xuemei forced out a smile and said, “Director, we too want to solve this case ASAP. But this case is way too special, while we don’t have the files of these people in our archives. If we really can determine that they are foreigners, then we can contact the Interpol. Only then can we get more clues.”
“I’ve reported this situation, and I believe we can get in touch with the Interpol soon. As long as we can be sure that they’re foreigners, it means that these people are international assassins as suspected. I think their target is living in South Gate Town since they died nearby its front entrance. Have you copied the CCTV footage for the residents who have gone out of the complex?” Deng Jianmin said.
“We already did that, Sir!” Cheng Xuemei replied.
“Then play and put it on the screen for the suspicious target.” Deng Jianmin said.
“Understood!” Cheng Xuemei complied.
The monitor screen played the footage. Since the video was set to fast play, ten minutes later, the image of Tang Xiu and Gu Yin leaving the complex was played on the screen.
"Wait!"
Cheng Xuemei’s face slightly changed and immediately shouted with a deep tone.
“Captain Cheng, did you find anything?” Deng Jianmin asked with a confused expression.
Cheng Xuemei spoke to the person who played the footage, “Rewind the video, and focus on the two who just came out before.”
Deng Jianmin watched the screen as his brows knitted a few seconds after and said, “That young man is kinda family, where have I seen him before?”
“Chief, he’s Tang Xiu.” Cheng Xuemei spoke with a deep tone.
Deng Jianmin’s pupils shrunk as he suddenly stood and spoke with a deepened tone, “That major case before, the killing of those A-level wanted criminals, he was suspected to be involved. In the kidnapping case at school, he was the one who acted and killed the criminal. But how can he also appear in this South Gate Town case?”
Cheng Xuemei shook her head and replied, “He lives there. And it looks like the little girl he was holding should also live together with him. The time on the footage is only half an hour from when the three assassins were killed.”
“Continue playing the surveillance footage.” Deng Jianmin said with a deep tone.

Along with the playing back of the video on the screen, everyone present frowned. Not long after, Tang Xiu walked with the little girl back to the villa complex, as they then watched the footage until the three assassins were killed, but Tang Xiu himself didn’t come out again.
“It’s not him?” One of the Criminal Police officers shook his head.
“As far I know, Tang Xiu is an expert martial artist. He can climb up the wall to leave the villa complex. Who can be sure that he’s not the one who killed those three assassins?” Cheng Xuemei replied with a sneer.
The other member of Criminal Police said, “Chief, we’ve gotten all CCTV videos for the entire area of South Gate Town. And according to the people in charge from the Property Management Office, there is nearly no black spots in the monitoring scope. And Tang Xiu wasn’t seen in the video leaving the villa complex in all of the footages, so we can exclude him from the suspect list.”
“Just keep watching.” Deng Jianmin said deeply.
3:30 AM
All of the monitoring video footages in South Gate Town had been played. In the end, Tang Xiu indeed didn’t leave South Gate Town.
“If Tang Xiu isn’t involved in this case, then who is it? We’ve screened all the residents that came out of the complex and excluded nearly everyone.” Cheng Xuemei said with a puzzled expression.
Deng Jianmin tapped the table with his fingers for a long while as he then slowly spoke, “Captain Cheng, go to South Gate Town tomorrow, ask Tang Xiu to work with us and gather information from him.”
Cheng Xuemei forced out a smile and said, “Director Deng, Tang Xiu’s disposition is… Well, he’s quite hard to get along with. Also, we have no evidence that he’s the one who did it. So I think that it’s quite improper if we rashly ask him to coordinate with us. The most important thing for us now is to gather some clues. Once we’ve determined the target, we can continue the investigation further.”
She hadn’t forgotten the previous case where she asked Tang Xiu to cooperate with her investigation, only to find nothing. And this time, she also had the same hunch, that even if she was to find Tang Xiu, she still wouldn’t get any useful information from him.
“No matter what, you’ll go there; regardless of he’s the murderer or not! More or less, he’ll still be intimidated. There have been too many major cases in Star City recently. If this keeps going like this, not only will I not last any long in my Bureau Director position, even all of you will also be punished severely!” Deng Jianmin said.
Cheng Xuemei couldn’t help but rub her forehead out of a headache. But she could only nod under Deng Jianmin’s order.
****
Life oftentimes feels bleak and uneventful by many. But for some others, they find that life was exciting and colorful in particular fashions. They could be successful, experience failures, fortunes and misfortunes, as everything was to fulfil and enriched life as it could be.
It’s already been two months after Tang Xiu returned from the Immortal World. But too many things had happened that he had to pass through. Sometimes, he also wanted to stop and take a break, but the turning wheel of fate was beyond what he could control. It pushed him forward, dragging him to advance without him being able to resist. However, as brave as he always was, the 10,000 years of life he had lived through in the Immortal World had tempered his heart as though it was a stone.
Inside the villa’s storehouse…
Tang Xiu was refining one medicinal drug, Corpse Dissolver.
In the Immortal World, this type of drug was used to completely destroy corpses and left no trace. A drop of it could destroy the corpse into a puddle of foul water, even the clothes wouldn’t remain.
Only after early morning did Tang Xiu come back to his room and slept until noon. After he woke up and took a bath, he went to the living room in the first floor and found Long Hanwen sitting there whilst drinking tea. Quietly sitting at his opposite side was Long Zhengyu, who was reading documents.
“Ah, when have you arrived, Uncle Long?” Tang Xiu approached and greeted them.
Long Hanwen narrowed his eyes as he looked at Tang Xiu, saying, “I just got here, since I had to collect some information first. Anyway, this house is very good. Got yourself comfy here?”
“It’s good!” Tang Xiu said.
Long Zhengyu kept the documents in his hands. He handed it over to Tang Xiu and said, “Never thought that my father would send people to gather the things you asked. It’s very thorough, so it can add to the information I’ve gotten this morning. Anyways, my father also wants you to see the contract we agreed to last night.”
Tang Xiu took the documents about the Zhang Family and read them carefully. He had no choice but admit that he was very insignificant compared to the Zhang Family. The assets calculation alone, the Zhangs had more than 20 billion and also had some trump cards within their arsenal. But even with the information provided by Long Hanwen, there was nothing about their home or their hidden trump card.
Shortly after, from Long Hanwen, Tang Xiu also read the contract that was made last night. His expression turned particularly strange after reading it as he chuckled, “Ah, opportunities truly can only be grasped by people who already prepared themselves. It seems that Uncle Long has prepared it quite well! I don’t know much about this contract, but I can see the problem within it. If the Zhang Family were to sign this contract and are short of liquid funds, I think they will run into a big trouble.”
“You can figure it out?” Long Hanwen’s brows slanted as he asked.
“Yea, I’m talking about this contract. I have nothing to say about the other clauses though. But there’s something bothering me. Your Long Family and the Zhangs are rivals; there are even some friction between your younger generation. Do you have any assurance that the Zhangs will sign this contract?” Tang Xiu asked.
Long Hanwen said with a light laugh, “Hahaha. Regardless of the world being at peace or chaotic, people will always chase profits and benefits. And what’s a businessman to begin with? They are nothing but people who’ll pursue profits. Zhang Fengxian, the head of the Zhang Family, is a fickle man. He has no friends. He can even sell his family members if it can give him some interests and profits. And from this contract, presuming that it can be completed, this would net a profit of at least one billion yuan for the Zhangs. Do you think Zhang Fengxian won’t be tempted by this? Also, this contract only includes the first phase of the joint cooperation, while there will also be subsequent projects following this. With such a huge prospect of profits, Zhang Fengxian would be a fool if he doesn’t sign this.”
“That makes sense. But there’s one more critical problem as of now. It’s about the Hu and Xue Families. I heard some news that the Hu and Xue Families’ strength are not as strong as the Zhangs’. But if the two were to join forces with them, I’m afraid that it will become quite troublesome.” Tang Xiu said.
“This problem is also a concern that I’m worried about. So, the reason as to why I wanted to see you this time is that I wanted to hear your opinion on this. Since you want to set a trap, you might have a plan ready.” Long Hanwen said with an unflinching expression.
Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I know nothing about business wars. But I do have a short term plan to smear the Zhangs’ reputation. Anyways, the Zhang Group have been listed in the stock market, haven't they? If their corporation’s reputation is damaged, I think their stock price will depreciate big time. Also, I can guarantee that at the beginning of the execution of the plan, the head of the Zhang Family, Zhang Fengxian, as well as some other important figures of the group will be missing. In this situation, where corporation big shots are missing, I believe that our plan will run smoothly.”
“Are you sure?” Long Hanwen asked with a deep tone.
“I don’t have a 100% assurance, but 99% is a sure shot.” Tang Xiu said without hesitation.
With a sinking tone, Long Hanwen replied, “That being the case, we’ll agree to the deal. Now tell me, are there any forces joining us in this aside from our Long Family and Chen Zhizhong?”
“I’m not sure whether the Ouyang Family will join or not, but for now, we have four forces in this. Your Long Family, Chen Zhizhong, and my two friends- Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen.” Tang Xiu said.
Long Hanwen was shocked, “You’re friends with Miao Wentang? The Miao Family’s head of Haiqing Province and the Big Boss of Miao Group?”

“Yes, I know him. We’ve been through thick and thin together and finally become friends. I called him last night and he agreed to participate.” Tang Xiu said with a nod.
“I have a friend in Haiqing Province also, he’s a great businessman. But he’s not worth mentioning compared to the Miao Group. Although Miao Wentang is very mysterious, but he’s very well-known. He is someone who has a very big influence in Haiqing Province.” Long Hanwen replied with disbelief.
“Actually, I don’t know if he’s that famous.” Tang Xiu said
Long Hanwen laughed and said, “Hahaha. Seems like my worry is unfounded. Tang Xiu, originally, I was worried that the people you invited have no weight. If so, my Long Family, added with Chen Zhizhong and Miao Wentang, our three forces alone are able to suppress the Zhang Family and will make them unable to even breathe. As for the other one… umm, Shao Mingzhen, I’ve never heard of him, what kind of business does he do?”
“He’s from Northern Jiangsu, he runs a venture company. But I don’t know his other identity nor if he has any other companies. But he and Miao Wentang are friends for decades, and I can tell that he’s Miao Wentang’s brother through life and death.”
“To be able to become Miao Wentang’s brother means that this Shao Mingzhen is also someone who has a great background. Anyways, when will they come here?” Long Hanwen said with a sigh.
“We agreed to meet tonight in the Long’s Dining Hall. When we’re all together, we’ll work out the plan.” Tang Xiu said.
Long Hanwen’s brows wrinkled as he pondered for a moment, and then said, “If possible, I think we best not to meet in the Long’s Dining Hall. Don’t forget that the place is the most prestigious restaurant in Star City, there should be a lot of eyes staring at the place. If so many important people gather there, the Zhang Family will certainly hear the news.”
“Where should we meet then?” Tang Xiu asked
“To keep everything confidential and in check, we should meet in Lakeview Manor! This place belongs to me and my life and death brother. I also own the shares there. Also, the place only has a few guests usually, while it also has a high security system.” Long Hanwen said.
“Alright, I’ll inform them about this.” Tang Xiu nodded and said.
“What about the Ouyang Family? When can they give us their reply?” Long Hanwen asked with a smile.
Tang Xiu looked toward the kitchen as he got up and went over, asking, “Big Sis Mu, when did Ouyang Lulu leave?”
“She left very early in the morning, and said she’ll go back to Jingmen Island; she even forgot to bid farewell!” Mu Qingping replied with a smile.
Tang Xiu nodded. He took his mobile and dialed Ouyang Lulu’s number. Ten seconds later, the call was connected and Ouyang Lulu’s voice came over:
“Wait two hours for me, my brother and I are coming. Talk again later.”
"Good!"
Tang Xiu hang up the phone. He came back to the living room and said, “Ouyang Lulu and her brother will arrive in Star City in two hours.”

The smiling expression on Long Hanwen’s face became a lot thicker as he said, “Ouyang Lei is the successor of the Ouyang Family. He’s also the rising star in the business world since he did quite a few big deals after he took over the Ouyang Family’s businesses. And all the deals he did brought quite a lot of income for the family. Since he’s also coming, it can be assumed that the Ouyang Family is also boarding our ship.”
Long Zhengyu suddenly interrupted, “With the joint cooperation of these five forces, the Zhangs are sure to die. I don’t think the Zhangs will be able to last even if the Hu and Xue Family come help them.”
Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You’re wrong. There’s the sixth force also.”
“Who is it?” Long Zhengyu was surprised.
Pointing to himself, Tang Xiu said with a faint smile, “You think that my Magnificent Tang Corporation is a pushover? We might not have much money as of now, but we still have our own force! Besides, I want my people in the key part of the plan.”
Long Zhengyu laughed involuntarily and then said, “Dang it. My bad, Brother Tang! I, too, heard that you have a group of powerful men- even the security personnel of South Gate Town are not their match.”
“Long Xueyao told you, did she? That’s right. I do have a group of men, and they will also be the ones taking care of this matter.” Tang Xiu said.
Long Zhengyu asked, “Anyway, may I know who they are, Brother Tang? How come you’re able to win them over?”
Tang Xiu smiled. He didn’t answer Long Zhengyu’s question since he didn’t want outsiders to know his secret with the Everlasting Feast Hall. In fact, he could have pulled the Everlasting Feast Hall to deal with this matter, but the Hall was built as a cover for Gu Yan’er, so he didn’t want to create trouble for it.
Suddenly, Long Hanwen said, "Tang Xiu, have you considered pulling Yuan Zhengxuan over? I heard you also have quite a good relationship with him!”
Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before he shook his head and said, “ Yuan Zhengxuan and I don’t have much of a relationship, but his son is my best friend! Besides, his business is very special, so I don’t want to pull him over for this matter.”
Long Hanwen nodded and said, “I know. His business is related to the military, and it’s indeed not suitable for this. However, as long as we give him some hints he will catch the wind, and perhaps he can help deal with some issues also.”
“With so many people involved in this matter right now, you’re still thinking we won’t able to remove the Zhang Family?” Tang Xiu asked in reply.
Long Hanwen stared blankly for a moment, then he shook his head and no longer spoke.
In actuality, he too had long wanted to remove the Zhang Family. As long as the Zhang Family collapsed, he would be able to dominate the real estate business in Star City. He realized that Tang Xiu had seen through him. But even though Tang Xiu was taking the lead for the plan, he would be happy as long as the Zhang Family was ruined.
However, he was quite shocked inside. He didn’t expect that Tang Xiu, who had just participated in College Entrance Test, could have such powerful personal contacts. From this aspect only, he was inferior. Otherwise, he would have dealt with the Zhang Family by himself.
Lunch time had come, but Long Hanwen and Long Zhengyu didn’t stay. They hurriedly left to rush to Lakeview Manor to arrange for the secret meeting tonight.
“Tang Xiu, policemen are visiting outside.”
Mu Qingping came to Tang Xiu’s bedroom and whispered.
The police?
Tang Xiu had long expected the police would come, but he didn’t expect it would be this fast. However, nowadays everything needed definite evidence. Moreover, he also believed he killed those three assassins cleanly. As long as Wolf Head didn’t sell him out, the police wouldn’t be able to find his involvement in the case.
“Alright, I’ll see them!” Tang Xiu quickly answered.
At the hall on the first floor.
Cheng Xuemei and a young police officer of the Criminal Division were sitting in the living room, waiting. The tea had been served, but they didn’t take it.
“Captain Cheng?”
Tang Xiu pretended to be surprised upon seeing Cheng Xuemei.
Cheng Xuemei stood up and looked at Tang Xiu with an indifferent expression as she said, “Mr. Tang, we’re sorry to disturb you. We’re investigating a homicide case that happened in front of South Gate Town’s front entrance. When we saw the CCTV footage, we found that you’re also living here. We want to find out the situation from you, so I hope you can cooperate with us.”
“Certainly.” Tang Xiu said with a smile.
“We’ve seen from the footage that you left the villa complex yesterday afternoon and quickly came back. May I ask whether you came out again after that?” Cheng Xuemei asked.
“No. After going out and coming back yesterday, I read some books and slept. I didn’t go out of the villa even a half step after that.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said.
“May I ask for what purpose did you go out yesterday?” Chen Xuemei asked.
“I accompanied my apprentice to buy tutoring and homework books. The stationery shop’s owner nearby the commercial street can prove my testimony.” Tang Xiu said.
Cheng Xuemei knitted her brows as she asked again, “You haven’t heard that there was a murder in front of the villa complex’s entrance?”
“I heard it from a friend who came visiting and stayed here yesterday. Three people were killed by gunshots, right? But, I’m really clueless though. You—the police force, should have been a deterrent force, but how come you’re stooping so low now? There have been a lot of murder cases recently in Star City, and this big responsibility is yours to take.”
Cheng Xuemei was truly helpless inside. She already knew that finding Tang Xiu wouldn’t result in any effect whatsoever, not even the tiniest clues or tracks could be gotten from him.
This guy… was unlike a young man, but more like a cunning old fox.
Soon after, Cheng Xuemei asked a few more questions, only to turn more desperate, since there was nothing to find. She looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Alright, I’m done with the questions. Thank you for your cooperation. Anyway, we bid you farewell as we still have more work to do.”
“Ah, why the hurry, Captain Cheng? How’s about having dinner first? I guarantee that my housekeeper’s culinary skills are first-class. Her cooking will make your appetite go wild and drive you to eat greedily.” Tang Xiu said with a smile.
Cheng Xuemei was quite incensed and amused at the same time as she said, “You think I still have the time to stay here for dinner? The case is beating me black and blue, and I even got no time to sleep since yesterday. But to think that you have a housekeeper, the changes you have undergone in the last two months are really great.”
“People need to move forward. The small business I’ve made recently got me some money. Otherwise, what you see me now wouldn’t make you feel this is the first time we meet each other, no?” Tang Xiu said with a smile.
Cheng Xuemei recalled the scene when she first met Tang Xiu. She immediately nodded and said, “You’re good. You can share your mother’s worries and do everything you can to be successful. Anyways, thanks for tutoring my younger sister.”
“We’re classmates, we ought to love each other.” Tang Xiu waved and replied.
Love each other?
Cheng Xuemei stared at Tang Xiu with a strange look. She kind of had the feeling that there was another meaning in this line. Could there be something between him and her little sister...
Her heart jolted and sped up. She stared at Tang Xiu seriously and asked, “You and my sister, shouldn’t the two of you be related as pure classmates only?”
“Nope!” Tang Xiu shook his head and said.
Chang Xuemei’s complexion changed, and her tone became stern and severe as she asked with a sinking tone, “What’s your relationship with her? My sister is still young, it’s not the time for her to have such a puppy love!”
Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry, “Huh? I said we’re not just classmates because we’re friends, comrades. What do you think we’re doing? Even if I ever liked a woman, I wouldn’t be interested in such a little girl like her, no? But you, you actually fit my standard though. What if you wait for me a few years, until I graduated from the college, to marry me and give me a child?”
