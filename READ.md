Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “No, I’m mistaken, absolutely. This aura definitely comes from a Fire Qilin! You can trust my guts on this, I’m a 100% sure of it.”
He couldn’t tell Shao Mingzhen that he had a powerful spiritual sense. Neither could he tell him that he had investigated to the end of the passageway of the cave with his perception and saw a Fire Qilin in deep slumber inside an enormous space. There were even several hundreds of sharply square-shaped sky sandstones neatly placed nearby the Fire Qilin, with each one of them weighing around a hundred pounds.
He also saw that there were also a small bed and a wooden table inside that cave’s space, while a glittering and translucent carved jade box rested on top of the table along with an ancient sword.
He had a lot of fortuitous encounters in the Immortal World, adventuring into a lot of Immortal Caves left by other Immortals and obtained a lot of treasures. But he never imagined that he would also come across such Immortal Cave on Earth.
However, he didn’t know whether or not it was a cultivator who left those down there.
As they retreated back above the Sky Cavern, Miao Wentang quickly asked, “How is it? What kind of harvest have you got down there?”
Tang Xiu said, “We haven’t got any for now. But we need to prepare something, so we gotta go back to Qingshan Town first. After everything is ready, we’ll enter the cave together- the three of us.”
“Brother Tang, what should we prepare?” Shao Mingzhen asked.
“Both of you, if you really want to brave the danger and hardships with me, you must listen to my arrangement. I can’t guarantee we’ll be able to come out alive from there. But if we are able to get out of there alive, I dare say that our harvest will be huge!” Tang Xiu said.
“Alright!”
“We’ll listen to you!”
Shao Mingzhen and Miao Wentang replied in unison.
Tang Xiu nodded and told his instructions, “Okay, it’s imperative that we think how will we handle this. Firstly, we need some explosives, but we don’t need too many. If we can’t find it, we can buy some fireworks, that will do. In addition, we also need more ropes and some boulders to quietly close the four entrances of the cave. But, we need to secretly deploy some traps inside before closing the entrances.”
Tang Xiu himself had already brewed the plan inside his mind. But the things that had to be prepared were quite a lot. It would be quite difficult to complete it within a couple of days once he carried out the plan.
However, he was determined to get those sky sandstones. He had once obtained this ore in the Immortal World, the stones were definitely the perfect material for refining tools. This kind of ore was very rare and was even usually regarded as treasures by the Immortals who could acquire them.
The next day. Evening.
Everyone returned back to Qingshan Town. Tang Xiu had written all the required materials on the list and handed it over to Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen’s men to buy them. Because some of the materials couldn’t be bought in Qingshan Town, they rushed to Cangbei City in the same night.

In the meantime, Tang Xiu also ordered some other men to buy the remaining materials that could be bought in Qingshan Town, as he then waited for them to return.
“Knock, knock…”
Someone knocked the door to the hotel’s room where Tang Xiu was staying.
As Tang Xiu opened it, he looked at Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen in front of the door with a puzzled expression, “Huh? You haven’t rested?”
Miao Wentang said with a smile, “Nope, we’re not tired since we’ve had our rest earlier! Anyways, we’re going downtown to have a meal and grab a drink, are you coming with us?”
Shao Mingzhen also followed and smiled, “I heard that the food stall downtown serves meat of wild games from the mountain. This place is close to the mountain and has a lot of wild games, so the taste should be quite good.”
Tang Xiu said with a laugh, “Hahaha, then what are we waiting for?”
Suddenly, Tang Xiu recalled that his mobile was out of battery yesterday and he charged it when he got back to Qingshan Town. Up until now, he hadn’t booted up his mobile, so he took the phone and followed the two men to the food stall.
On the road.
As he turned the phone on, missed calls and text messages’ sound notifications immediately rang continuously.
Tang Xiu looked at the screen. Aside from missed calls from Chu Yi and Long Zhengyu, his mother—Su Lingyun also called him. The text itself was sent by Ouyang Lulu, asking what he was doing right now.
_"Adventuring!"_
After replying and sending the text to Ouyang Lulu, Tang Xiu then dialed his mother’s cell number.
“Hello? Xiu’er?”
An anxious voice that belonged to Su Lingyun came out of the speaker.
Tang Xiu said with a laugh, “Hello Mom, sorry for not accepting your phone before. Anyways, did anything happen for you to call me?”
“Xiu’er, you told me that you were going to travel, where are you? Can you come back now? Mom has to talk to you about something urgent!” Su Lingyun quickly spoke.
Tang Xiu was startled and then replied with a deep tone, “Mom, calm down a bit first. What happened?”
Su Lingyun’s tone was particularly low and deep as she replied, “It’s your uncle. He had an accident at his house. Both of your cousins came to me, they…”
Tang Xiu abruptly interrupted her and said, “Mom, you don’t need to say more. I know that. The police have apprehended Su Shangwen and Zhang Meiyun and they are now facing years of imprisonment, aren’t they?”
“Xiu’er, how did you know about this? Did you…” Su Lingyun hastily asked.
“Yes, Mom. I have instructed some people to do that. Su Shangwen and Zhang Meiyun have had their own good days. But when they went to the hospital to humiliate you, I really couldn’t stand them any longer. They have crossed my bottom line since I’ve sworn in my heart that whoever dares to disrespect you, I’ll make it so they no longer have any good days! I did promise you that I can guarantee Su Shangwen’s life and safety, but I didn’t say anything as to what kind of life he will have in the future.” Tang Xiu said
For a long while, Su Lingyun was silent. As she spoke after, her tone was bitter and astringent, “Xiu’er, even if Mom did feel bad and disheartened, but he’s still my blood brother! Ah… in fact, it’s Zhang Meiyun who has been arrested. As for Su Shangwen, he attempted to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was discovered quickly and can still be rescued in the hospital. But it won’t be long before he will also be arrested.”
Committing suicide?
Tang Xiu frowned and said, “He can’t stand the blow and wants to die?”
Su Lingyun said, “Yes. Although he’s been rescued, he hasn’t passed the dangerous period. Xiu’er, Mom begs you…. your uncle… he, can’t you help him out? He was at the point of death once, maybe he’d change and redeem his mistakes and becomes a better man later!”
Tang Xiu didn’t speak.
Ever since she brought him up, it was the first time his mother asked him something. He wanted to refuse, telling her that even though Su Shangwen might have died once, but as persistent as a dog could be, he couldn’t, and wouldn’t, change. However, as the words were at the tip of his tongue, he swallowed them back inside.
After a long while, Tang Xiu replied with a wry tone, “Mom, this will be the last time. If he really changes, then that would be for the best. But if he doesn’t or stays a bastard as he’s always been, don’t stop me by then.”
“Alright!” Su Lingyun quickly gave her word.
Tang Xiu took a sigh and then said, “Mom, I’m in Dongyuan Province now, and it will still be a couple of days before I go back. As for this matter with Su Shangwen, I’ll make some calls to handle it.”
Su Lingyun replied with a hesitating tone, “Xiu’er, I’ve been having a feeling that you’ve been concealing something from me. I remembered you telling me to wait after the College Entrance Test, only then would you tell me about it.”
“Wait until I got back and I’ll tell you everything, Mom!” Tang Xiu said.
After the call ended, Tang Xiu was struck with quite a headache as he rubbed his forehead. Soon after, he contacted Chen Zhizhong and told him to give Su Shangwen a way out.
As for the rest of the time, he also called back Long Zhengyu and Chu Yi respectively. He was especially happy that Chu Yi had sent him a number of precious herbs from the capital, but then began to worry as he knew the sum of money involved.
Chu Yi himself didn’t tell him as for how much he had spent for those precious medicinal herbs. But Long Zhengyu told him that the total value of those medicinal herbs was nearly 200 million yuan.
It was money again!
Tang Xiu smiled wryly as he put his phone back. Without him realizing, he, Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen had arrived at the food stalls as the other two had already ordered a la carte. Shaking his head in secret, Tang Xiu casually looked for an open-air table and sat there.
“I, this old man, have really decided to mend my own life and make a new start. And you know what? The line as for how we should be able to stand next to the riverside without wetting our own shoes, truly has given me a fierce, unforgettable lesson this time. Today, after we finish this wine, I’ll go to a big city. If I can’t make my way around there on the outside, I’ll go home and continue making wine.”
A loud and clear voice was heard from ten meters away.
Tang Xiu felt this voice sounded somewhat familiar. He followed the voice’s direction and looked at the back as he recognized the person who spoke. He was precisely the man he had given a lesson to, the Scarblade Qiang. And satting with him on the table, were not the dozens of big guys he encountered before, but new faces of seven or eight middle-aged men with big builds.
“Big Brother Qiang, we’ve long advised you to not indulge yourself in such things. We’re, after all, no longer able to eat to the full alone while we leave our family starved. If you’re going to do something, you must take sister-in-law and your children into account and think about them. Since you’ve come to your senses, we—brothers, show respect to you with a toast.”
“That’s right! You’ve always been a smart one and have upright manners, Big Brother Qiang. Even if you do honest business, I’m sure you’ll be successful in the future. A toast to you!”
“Brother Qiang, if you can’t work your way out in the outside, just come back and brew wine again. Besides, your winemaking skill is great, and we—brothers know it very well. At the worst, I can do a side job as well while you brew wine. So if the sale isn’t good, I can travel to some cities and help you sell them.”
"..."
Scarblade Qiang looked at these several brothers he grew up with an expression of being moved. He raised his wine cup and spoke spiritedly, “You’re all truly my good brothers, and brothers won’t say thanks with words. Come! In regards to your kindly wishes and wines, let’s dry our cups!”
At the side, a tinge of a smile emerged on Tang Xiu’s face. Such a scene of a prodigal son returned back home was worth more than gold. Scarblade Qiang turned out to have good nature, and the fact that he could win over a gang of brothers and friends explained that he was a capable man. if he was truly able to make a fresh start in life, he believed that he would certainly be successful in the future.
That aside, winemaking indeed was a good business.
Tang Xiu nodded whilst smiling. But quickly, his expression paused. An idea suddenly appeared in his mind. Wasn’t he himself preparing to brew wines after he returned to Star City? If Scarblade Qiang was also going to brew liquor, how about he take him along to help him brew his wine? He could also open a wine business as a whole! As long as this Scarblade Qiang made wines according to his wine recipe, he would definitely be able to brew good wines and simply won’t have to worry about selling them once it hit the market.
Besides, the wine business didn’t need much investment funds, and he was fully able to make one. In the case that Scarblade Qiang wasn’t suited for management, Kang Xia was still able to handle this aspect.
As Tang Xiu thought up to there, he looked back to Scarblade Qiang.
“Brother Tang, the food and wine in this food stall are truly great. We have so many options!” Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen came back cheerfully as they sat down beside Tang Xiu.



Tang Xiu wasn’t paying any attention to any delicacies right now. His mind was fully occupied with two kinds of thoughts. Firstly, he wanted to snatch the “food” from the Qilin’s mouth and take out the sky sandstones from the cavern. Even if he could only get a few pieces out, it was enough for his uses for a long time. Secondly, he needed to make money. And with the addition of nearly 200-million-yuan new debt, it made him be more determined to do it.
“Anyways, I’ve already received your money. But can I ask you something? Are the two of you quite rich?”
Whilst looking at the two men’s smiling faces, Tang Xiu shifted his attention toward them. He had a lot of good things which were ten thousand times better than the Beast Subduing Secret Art. He thought that as long as Shao Mingzhen and Miao Wentang could provide the sum, he could sell them something. At least for a sum that would enable him to clear his current debt.
Miao Wentang asked with a confused tone, “Huh? We can say we have some. But anyway, are you in a very dire need of money, Brother Tang?”
“Pretty much!” Tang Xiu said.
Miao Wentang said with a smile, “How much do you need? As long as we have the amount you need, you can take the money first.”
Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Nah, I thought to have some deals with the two of you if you have a lot of money. But the premise is that you _do_ have enough money for it.”
Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen glanced at each other as they replied one after another:
“Well, I can take out 1.5 billion without a problem.”
“1 billion for me.”
A smile revealed all over Tang Xiu’s face as he said, “You’re lucky that I’m in debt now. I’ll sell a set of Immortal cultivation technique to you for 2.5 billion, how about it?”
An Immortal cultivation law and technique?
A trace of awkward expression revealed on Miao Wentang’s face as he replied with a forced smile, “Brother Tang, if it’s something else, perhaps we’re happy to accept it. For instance, that Beast Subduing Secret Art of yours. But you too know that we are also cultivators ourselves and we have our own inheritances of cultivation laws and techniques. Even if you sell us another set of cultivation technique, we won’t be able to cultivate it, will we?”
Shao Mingzhen also nodded and said, “Practicing two kinds of cultivation techniques simultaneously is a no-no since I think it’s a much better choice to focus on practicing one type of cultivation technique. Besides, we also have limited energy, to begin with.”
Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “No, if you heard me clearly, what I offered you is not a Daoist cultivation technique, but an Immortal cultivation one.”
Involuntarily laughing upon hearing this, Miao Wentang then said, “Brother Tang, what nonsensical things are you speaking? Where would such Immortal cultivation technique exist in this world?”
Tang Xiu turned his head and waved to the staffer of the food stall, asking to lend him a paper and pen. After that, he wrote a set of ordinary cultivation technique on the paper as well as adding clear and detailed annotations and illustrations to practice it. Then, he gave it to Miao Wentang and lightly spoke, “Read this set of cultivation technique exercises, if you feel that it isn’t worth 2.5 billion yuan, I’ll talk no longer.”

Miao Wentang received it with a skeptical expression, while Shao Mingzhen gathered up with him. The two of them then read the written Immortal cultivation technique Tang Xiu gave them with serious expressions.
Half a minute later.
An astonished expression revealed on their faces.
A minute later.
Their expression changed into a flabbergasted one.
Two minutes later.
They stood with trembling bodies and their eyes tightly stared at the Immortal cultivation technique in their hands without them realizing it.
Five minutes later.
They turned their head with difficulty and looked at Tang Xiu with shocked expressions, and were unable to express anything for a long time.
“You… d-do you really want to sell this for 2.5 billion yuan?” Finally, Miao Wentang asked with a shivering voice.
"Yes!"
Tang Xiu replied with a calm tone.
Miao Wentang pounded the table and exclaimed loudly, “DEAL! 2.5 billion yuan then. We are willing to even sacrifice everything for this one! Wait for a few days and I’ll transfer the money into your account!”
Shao Mingzhen also loudly said, “NO, no need for a couple of days later! I’ll contact the General Manager of my company to transfer the money to your account ASAP! I and Brother Miao will share the pay!”
Ten meters away from the outside.
The group of people who were drinking with Scarblade Qiang was startled upon hearing the sudden shouts from Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen.
One of the big men, who was already red drunk, exclaimed resentfully, “Those people in that table are really damn idiots! Those idiots made this Big Daddy startled and almost made me wet my pants. I’m a timid person, you scared me out, so you’ll truly get your share!”
Another man also said loudly, “Yes! Our hearts are not strong enough to be startled by you! And what’s this 2.5 billion bull? Even if you wanna show off, you gotta look around you! Don't you fear that some ghosts will blow you out? If you got 2.5 billion, why the hell are you eating in a bird shit food stall like this huh?”
Scarblade Qiang also fiercely turned his head as he stared angrily at Shao Mingzhen and Miao Wentang. However, when his vision inadvertently swept toward the smiling Tang Xiu, his vision suddenly froze.
In a split second after, Scarblade Qiang jumped up from his chair as he fiercely slapped the head of his two brothers and cursed, “Is there nothing you can do but make a racket when drinking? Those two brothers were just speaking a little loud, what the hell is wrong with that? I wonder if I can scare you to the death!”
The two big men were dumbfounded. They couldn’t figure out as to why Scarblade Qiang did that and what his intention was.
Scarblade Qiang ignored them and ran to the food stall’s owner. He took two bottles of the most expensive liquor. He held them with his uninjured hand and came over toward Tang Xiu with a smiling face as he bowed and said, “Brother, I’m really sorry. These brothers of mine have drunk quite a lot, I hope you won’t take their attitudes to heart. Please consider this two bottles of wine as an apology. I hope you can enjoy your drink.”
One of Scarblade Qiang’s brothers could only look at his actions with a dumbfounded expression. As he sobered up after his daze, he called out with a forced smile, “Brother Qiang, your intention to turn a new leaf in life, is kinda way too fast, no? You were a hot-headed real guy before, how come you’ve turned a counselor now? What did you apologize to them for? It should be them coming to our table and apologize. By rights, they should be the one who proposes the toast to us!”
"Shut the hell up!"
Scarblade Qiang raised his newly treated right hand as he shouted angrily at him.
As for Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen, what Scarblade Qiang had done got them confused. They too realized that they lost a bit out of their self-restraint, so they spoke with louder voices. But how come this injured big guy with a knife scar on his face would dash over and apologize with a look of trying to please them with everything he got? And the look in his eyes, it was as though he was seeing something horrible.
Tang Xiu said indifferently, “Well, nothing’s happened, and it’s no big deal either, so let’s forget it. You did good and I’m very happy for you.”
Scarblade Qiang was immediately ecstatic upon hearing this. He repeatedly nodded and said, “Brother, thanks for the understanding and kind words. These brothers of mine are kinda dense and careless. How about I drag them here to show respect to you with a few cups?”
He said this, but he was actually anxious to immediately run and get out of this place. He had seen how frightening Tang Xiu could be. In his heart, Tang Xiu was an existence of a vicious and merciless demonic star!
But much to his shock, Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Those brothers of yours need not propose a toast to me, but you. I need to discuss something with you. After you finish your chores, wait for my call.”
"Ugh, what?"
Scarblade Qiang was stunned. He tried to squeeze out a trace of a smile, but his expression was even more unsightly than crying. He really wanted to run, but he didn’t have the guts to disobey Tang Xiu. In the end, he could only nod and reluctantly promise with a desperate feeling inside.
As he returned to the table, one of the big fellows who was confused, asked, “Brother Qiang, who is that kid? Why did you look like you bumped into a ghost and even need to prostate and be scared shitless in front of him?”
Scarblade Qiang swallowed the saliva in his mouth. He turned and glanced at Tang Xiu. As he saw that he didn’t see him, he felt a bit relieved. Then, he stuck his head and whispered, “Shut the hell up, will you? Don’t you see this broken wrist of mine? This was done by that expert. Him! He knocked me and dozens of my men down quickly and easily. He even casually snatched the gun in my hand when I pointed it at him. Do you think the lot of you are his match?”
"Hiss…"
The other big fellows on the table sucked deep breaths of cold air one after another.
They heard what had happened to Scarblade Qiang before, that he unexpectedly encountered a vicious and ruthless person. Instead of robbing the person, it was him and his boys who got robbed by the said fierce fellow in the end. The two big fellows who were just speaking had their foreheads slowly suffused by cold sweat as they glanced at Scarblade Qiang with a grateful look.
“I also have seen those two friends of his. They’re staying in our town’s hotel. And I tell you, they got a lot of bodyguards around. But…” A big guy began to speak but hesitated afterward.
“But what?” Scarblade Qiang followed with a confused expression.
“I don’t know what kind of people they are. But they are definitely not your casual ordinary people! Those two men… along with their bodyguards, were as if just had ventured to the Primeforest Mountain Range, but they came back with quite the casualties afterward. You all know that my wife is an attendant in that hotel. She witnessed everything! Those who died were carried off by an off-road vehicle, and those two were also severely injured and unable to even walk. But the most mysterious thing is, their injuries were nearly healed completely within just two or three days!”
"So scary?"
Scarblade Qiang and the other fellows were shocked. Such a matter was truly inconceivable.
But, they were secretly happy that they didn’t make the Tang Xiu trio enraged.
After an hour.
After the Tang Xiu trio had sated their hunger to the full and was about to pay the bill, the food stall’s owner told them that Scarblade Qiang had paid their bills.
Tang Xiu looked at the other table and saw that Scarblade Qiang was sitting and waiting there alone. Then, he spoke to the Miao Wentang duo, saying, “You two go back first! I have some private matters I need to deal with.”
"Alright!"
Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen quickly complied as they took a stroll toward the hotel. Tang Xiu had powerful abilities and they didn’t worry that he would fall into accidents.
In the food stalls.
Tang Xiu waved to Scarblade Qiang. After he came over, he pointed to the opposite chair as he said with a smile, “Sit down!”
Scarblade Qiang sat down with an obedient smile even though he was actually restless inside as if he was sitting on a pincushion. Then, he asked, “Brother, you asked me to stay behind, what instructions do you have for me?”
Tang Xiu said, “I’m really happy looking at your performance today. Being able and determined to turn a new leaf in life showed that you really adhered to my advice. So I want to give you a chance.”
“A chance? What kind of opportunity?” Scarblade Qiang asked with a puzzled expression.
“I overheard that you’re good in brewing liquor and you also have a good craftsmanship, do you not?” Tang Xiu asked.
Scarblade Qiang quickly replied, “I did inherit winemaking techniques from my old man. Before I was 25, I helped my old man brew liquors. After he passed away and returned to the Western Paradise, I gave up and abandoned my family’s distillery and then spent my time fooling around with a group of local ruffians. After I mixed with them for quite a while, I racked up quite a reputation and became, well, their Boss. Ugh, Big Brother, I also kinda let those successes get into my head. If it weren’t for you giving me such a fierce lesson, I would still have repeated the same wrong deeds over and over again even if I know that I might have big troubles upon me in the future.”
