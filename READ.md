 roar came from the corridor, followed by fierce gunshots immediately afterward, “DON’T LET THEM RUN! KILL THEM!”
Dozens of pirates rushed in, but after the door was kicked open, nobody was found inside and all the windows were opened.
Two minutes later.
Tang Xiu and the others gathered in the lush woods behind the castle. Apart from one man who had a bullet wound in his arm, the rest were uninjured.
Patting the injured man, Tang Xiu whispered, “How’s your injury? Is it serious?”
“It’s fine!” the man shook his head.
Turning his head to Wolf Head, Tang Xiu asked in a deep voice, “Who is that pirate who dared to kill Duffsky? Is he not afraid of the other pirates killing him?”
“That’s the second leader of the Bloodfish Pirates. This accident is due to my poor plans since I forgot that these pirates are a ruthless and heartless bunch. The other pirates won’t blame him for killing Duffsky. They are not idiots, they surely know that they will likely be killed by us after surrendering,” said Wolf Head.
“Tonight’s action has failed, so we’ll withdraw immediately. I can’t afford to lose our people to some pirates. If they have the courage, they will continue staying inside the castle. But in any case, we’ll continue the attack in the early morning,” assented Tang Xiu with a nod.
“Boss, your next plan is….” Said Wolf Head curiously.
“My plan is very simple,” said Tang Xiu and grimly smiled. “We’ll find every opportunity to sneak raid those pirates constantly. Kill them one by one and as many as we can. All in all, I will kill them and make them so terrified that they’ll run away. As long as they come out from the castle, they’re dead.”
The rest looked at each other and assented with nods. They similarly loathed these evil pirates and had no hesitation to slay them.
Late at night.
Two kilometers away from the castle. Tang Xiu and the rest hid amidst the boulders and trees, quietly watching the castle. They heard sounds of gunfire coming from that side and the roar of the pirates.
The sounds were getting closer and closer.
“Ten men with submachine guns about 650 meters away are searching for us,” standing behind the boulder, Wolf Head poked his head out to probe and whispered.
Tang Xiu motioned the Mo brothers as the two quietly slipped into nearby trees immediately. He then said, “Wolf Head, immediately attack them once they reach the vicinity. Do keep in mind to assign the task well and strive to decimate them completely.”
"Yes!" Wolf Head replied in a low voice.
Seven or eight minutes later.
Ten armed pirates had caught up to them, but they didn’t use flashlights because the enemies were hiding and they didn’t want to be attacked in the dark.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Several silhouettes silently appeared near the ten pirates. As daggers stabbed into their bodies, more ferocious attacks were launched as they screamed.
Within just five or six seconds, the ten pirates didn’t even have time to shoot and were all killed, giving ten submachine guns to Wolf Head and the others.

Tang Xiu kicked the corpse of one of the pirates to the side and coldly looked toward the castle. According to Wolf Head’s number count, the number of pirates in the castle should have fallen to less than 100. With ten more of them killed now, the number of pirates lessened yet again.
Soon, the two brothers—Mo Awen and Mo Awu returned with ten guns. They dropped the guns around Tang Xiu and then wiped the blood off their faces, saying, “We also found ten pirates in another direction, so we cleaned them up and also robbed their guns. Anyways, Boss. Should we rush ahead again?”
A smile appeared on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he shook his head and said, “No need to hurry. We’re now in the dark while the enemies are in the light. We just need to monitor the entire castle. Once some people came out, kill them. I must make those remaining bastards scared shitless, letting them know what fear is.”
“How about me and Awu secretly sneak into the castle to kill some more tonight?” asked Mo Awen.
Tang Xiu laughed, “No problem. Of course, I will also sneak in to kill some of them. Wolf Head, you’ll be responsible for monitoring the entire castle. Can you do it?”
Forcing out a wry smile, Wolf Head said, “This castle is rather large and there are a lot of spots we can use to sneak in. We’ll try our best though.”
“Don’t worry, they won’t dare to come out so easily either. Even if they do, they will probably come out together,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.
“It shouldn’t be a problem then. The twelve of us will hold one spot each and seal off all the easy paths down the roads descending from the hill,” said Wolf Head.
Inside the castle.
Ingelund was holding a submachine gun as he quietly sat in the palatial hall. On the floor in front of him were 78 dead bodies into a pool of blood. Those were the male civilians caught by them. He was in a dire urge to kill, for only blood could stimulate him so that he wouldn’t fall into fear.
The number of pirates in the castle which numbered 242 men had been reduced to only 96 after several losses, while the other party were but only a dozen.
They were experts. And powerful ones at that!
He was also once an expert—an ace of the United States’ marine corps. As a result of having a conflict with someone in the army and due to him killing the other party, he deserted and escaped the army. Years after escaping he eventually took shelter under Duffsky.
However, he had never once seen such intrepid team. Even the top-notch soldiers in the Marine Corps he was enlisted in that year perhaps couldn’t be compared to the other party.
“Second Chief, the Third Chief—Hutu sent two searching teams, a total of 20 men, and they haven’t come back until now. Could they gotten in an accident?” A burly, ugly and ferocious looking man strode in from the outside carrying a submachine gun and dozens of magazines on his waist.
Ingelund stared blankly before he suddenly jumped up from the sofa with eyes almost able to kill. He grabbed the big man’s clothes and angrily shouted, “What did you say? Hu Tu sent 20 brothers to seek the enemies?”
“Yes!” the burly man was somewhat frenetic and quickly replied.
“How long has it been?” Ingelund roared.
“About an hour,” said the burly guy.
Releasing the burly man, Ingelund paled and slightly shivered inside. He had once undergone regular army training and went to many countries to carry out secret missions. Many times had he survived through the forest of guns and hail of bullets, so he knew perfectly well… what the true strength of an elite was.
These enemies were fearsome!
Sending out 20 brothers; Hutu had just sent them to die.
Fuming with anger, Ingelund said, “Where the fuck is Hutu?”
The burly man said, “The third leader is deploying a defensive perimeter and assigning some brothers to stay hidden and some to stay visible as sentries outside. Thus, we’ll be able to discover the enemies once they approach this area.”
Clenching his fist, Ingelund strode out of the hall and quickly found Hutu. Without any words, he dashed toward Hutu and grabbed his ionized-scalding long hair, forcefully pulling it down and knee kicking Hutu’s abdomen, directly sending him into a shrimp-like shape as his body curled up and twitched on the ground.
Following that, he ferociously kicked Hutu’s body several times and angrily cursed, “You—fucking goddamn idiot, didn’t you see the strength of the enemy clearly? We have more than 200 people, yet with only a dozens of men they killed more than 100 of us. Now tell me, have you seen this kind of enemy before, huh?
“Yet, you unexpectedly sent 20 brothers without my permission. You—fucking bastard just sent those brothers to die. I dare say those 20 brothers have already been killed near the castle by now.
“What a fucking stupid pig! You know nothing about tactics because you—asshole decided to send out the remaining brothers, causing us to receive great casualties yet again. You’re no longer the Bloodfish Pirate’s third leader henceforth.
“All of you, listen to me. Nobody is ever to listen to him again unless you want to be killed by him.
“Did you all hear me?”
The dozens of pirates nearby watched as Hutu curled up and screamed on the ground. After which, they glanced at the furious Ingelund and finally replied loudly, “Yes. We heard it!”
Ingelund took a deep breath, grabbed Hutu up and said, “If you weren’t the only sniper in our Bloodfish pirates and because your loyalty to me, I would really have fucking killed you already. Do remember to stay with me from now on.”
"Yes!"
Hutu knew how fearsome Ingelund’s strength was, as well as his ruthlessness. Though he was somewhat resentful inside, he was still respectful toward the man.
As Ingelund dropped Hutu, he then spoke in a heavy tone, “Call all of our brothers back to the castle and pack up everything. Collect all the weapons in the castle. We can’t stay here any longer or else we’ll be killed by the enemies.”
“S-second Chief, do you mean… we’re running away?” An ordinary pirate leader asked aloud.
Ingelund said in a heavy tone, “Though speaking about ‘running away’ is rather humiliating to us, that’s the truth. The enemies are way too powerful. I had once served in the United States’ Marines Corps and fought numerous top fighters from various countries in the world, so I know very well the strength of our enemies. Small in numbers, they are only a dozen people. Yet, be it their individual capabilities or teamwork, they are of the best and the most formidable bunch I’ve ever seen in my life. We’ll die here if we don’t run. And they will continue to sneak-raid and kill us. Now tell me, do you… want to die here?”
“NO. I DON’T WANT TO DIE HERE!”
All the remaining pirates shouted loudly.
“Then run from this place since you don’t wanna die! We’re pirates. Encountering a powerful bunch, we immediately run; meeting weak prey, we squeeze them out of all they have! So get your asses ready to leave this island!!!”
“YES!”


Dozens of pirates returned to the castle and began packing up all the weapons and ammo as well as preparing enough food for the trip. Desperate criminals they might be, but dying was never something they wanted. They were pirates. They committed the most heinous crimes and were wanted by the Interpol. Yet, looting and plundering were what they felt to be in line with their work style.
If someone could live, who the hell would want to die? For dying meant that there would be nothing left for them.
A burly man came to Ingelund and croaked, “Second Chief, what should we do with all the captives? Kill them?”
Knitting his brows, Ingelund asked in a deep voice, “How many of them are left?”
“Except for the seven you just killed, there are still 126 left. Our brothers have them locked up. We can kill them all at once as long as you issue the order,” said the burly man.
“How much food is left in the castle exactly?” asked Ingelund once again.
“It should be enough for two months’ provisions for our brothers,” said the burly man.
A brilliant spark glinted in Ingelund’s eyes as he said in a deep voice, “Take ten people and keep the rest here. And do remember to take all the food in the castle. Humph… those people said that this place is theirs. I wanna fucking see how they deal with the rest of the captives.”
“Huh?” the burly man was puzzled. “Second Chief, why are we leaving them here? Almost all the remaining captives are women, even our brothers have yet to farm dozens of them! Leaving them to the enemies is way too cheap, no?”
“You know nothing, idiot,” Ingelund smiled grimly. “We’re taking all the food and leaving the captives here, but they too have to eat. If those people don’t care about the life and death of these captives, they will not give their food to these women and thus will starve them to death. But if they do give some of their provisions to these women, humph… would their provisions be able to support that?”
“You mean…” the burly was astonished, “You want to drag down the enemies with the women?”
“Exactly!” said Ingelund proudly.
The burly man hesitated for a moment and then said, “Then why don’t we leave all the women behind instead of taking only ten of them?”
Ingelund slapped the burly man’s head and cursed angrily, “Are you a fucking idiot? Nobody can say if we can escape safely! For now, we can only expect that they won’t ignore the captives. If they do, we can use those ten as hostages to get away scot-free!”
“I see!” the burly man scratched his head as his rough face grinned hideously.
The Bloodfish pirates moved very fast, which was something they rarely did. Within a short half an hour, all the weapons and foodstuffs in the castle had been packed up. Each and every one of them now carried a large bag as they quietly left the castle from the back under the protection of 20-30 armed pirates.
As for the civilian they held captive, all of them were locked up in the hall, as even all the windows were tightly nailed with planks.

Halfway up the hillside behind the castle, Wang Ming and his comrade were hiding amid the thick patches of grass with mini binoculars in their hands, watching all the movements in the castle’s surroundings.
“Someone’s coming!” Wang Ming suddenly whispered.
The other man observed for several seconds and then whispered back, “It’s the pirates in the castle. They are seemingly about to flee.”
Wang Ming nodded, took out a satellite phone and dialed a number.
“Wolf Head, the pirates are about to flee. They’re carrying a large number of arms and foodstuff and are also holding ten civilians. They are heading up toward the back hill.”
“Copy that! Be careful and take cover!”
Wolf Head’s voice came from the satellite phone.
In another direction.
Taking back the satellite phone, Wolf Head looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Boss, those pirates are about to run away and heading toward Wang Ming’s position. They should be taking down the trails there. And I suspect that their ships are also hidden there.”
“Let’s catch up and find the right time to strike and kill them. Tell the rest to prioritize their safety first,” said Tang Xiu with a sneer.
"Roger that!"
Wolf Head immediately used the satellite phone and typed a message to the group.
Ten minutes later, Tang Xiu led Wolf Head and the others to Wang Ming’s location. Watching the leaving pirates on the curving hill road below through mini binoculars, Tang Xiu coldly smiled and said in a deep voice, “Awen, Awu. How many people can you kill without injuring the civilians if you were to ambush them?”
“At least ten,” said Mo Awen after pondering for a moment.
“Then go! Also, throw them into confusion and make some trouble for them to slow down their escape.” Tang Xiu approved with a nod.
“Roger that!”
Mo Awen and Mo Awu replied and soon disappeared into the nearby woods.
Turning to look at Wolf Head, Tang Xiu then said, “Take your men and cross to the side. Try to set some traps in front of them within 20 minutes, and then kill as many pirates as you can.”
“Copy that!”
Licking his lips, Wolf Head replied and immediately left with the other eleven men.
Tang Xiu stepped on the boulder and quickly chased downwards. He moved fast and as smooth as usual. Within just two minutes, he had caught up hundreds of meters behind the fleeing opposite party. Without being discovered by them, he then went into hiding.
“Bang, bang, bang…”
A series of gunshots were heard as several pirates in the forefront fell to the ground one after another. Two submachine guns’ licking flames were as though harvesters that claimed the lives of the pirates in the forefront as though they were wheat. As for Ingelund who was in the forefront, were it not because of his fast reaction to instantly grab a pirate near him to block the line of bullets, he would have also been shot dead.
“SCATTER AND STRIKE BACK!”
Ingelund pushed the pirate’s sieved dead body and retreated into the bushes nearby like a cheetah. After rolling for several times and positioning himself there, he aimed the muzzle of his submachine gun at the direction of the shots.
“Bang, bang…”
As the dark muzzled aimed to the front and the trigger was pulled, bullets sprayed as though a torrential downpouring. Branches were sent flying and rocks were scattered around. Yet, the sound of gunshots had stopped and the two enemy men had already left that position.
Right at this moment, the other pirates who were carrying guns also began to counterattack toward the direction where the gunshots started. After half a minute of shooting, some people even had changed to their second magazine.
“STOP FIRING AND SAVE YOUR AMMO!” Ingelund growled.
Immediately, the pirates no longer fired, but they still hid in the surrounding thicket, looking for the enemies through the slit of branches and leaves. Unfortunately, no matter how they looked for them, they couldn’t any of their traces.
This waiting game was exceptionally terrible!
Intense fear engulfed the heart of every pirate, for they couldn’t even see a shadow of the enemies who had ruthlessly shot dozens of their brothers. Looking through the branches and leaves at those who had fallen in a pool of blood, their hearts fell into the abyss.
“S-second Chief, what should we do?”
Armed with a sniper rifle, Hutu had been observing for quite a long time through his sniper scope, yet he couldn’t find even a trace of the enemies. He carefully turned back and asked Ingelund who was a few meters away from him.
With coldness suffused in his eyes, Ingelund shook his head and looked at the back. He then spoke in a heavy voice, “Tell someone to use those civilians to block the guns, making them our human shields. If those bastards hiding in the dark were to open fire, let them kill those civilians first!”
Quickly, seven or eight pirates crawled up from the thicket and quickly came in front of the ten civilians who were lying on the ground. After beating them for a while, they picked them up from the ground and pushed their backs.
“Take the lead!”
The ten civilians, six of whom were men and four were rather pretty women were forced to help the pirates to carry the food and medicines.
At this moment, they looked deathly pale with frightened expressions. Two quite timid women even had their legs trembling.
“P-please, I beg you. Don’t kill us.”
A tall and big man suddenly wept like a little girl out of fright. His legs were trembling, lips shivering, and there even was a watermark in his crotch.
“You fucking asshole. You got scared and peed yourself?”
The pirate behind him who just smelt his pee smashed the tall man’s head fiercely, causing the badly beaten man to straightly fall to the ground.
After that, he then grabbed the man again, pushing his gun against him to make the man lead the way in front.
“Tak…”
A stone suddenly came shooting from the distant thicket and accurately hit that pirate’s temple. A bloody was hole created, directly killing him.
Quickly, the leaves and branches of that thicket swayed as a man’s silhouette flashed.
Down the middle of the pirates, Ingelund, who found that another man was killed, wasn’t startled as he shouted loudly, “All you lot be alerted! Be careful not to be caught in a sneak attack by the enemy again. If those bastards dare to attack again and kill one of our brothers, just kill one civilian.”
“Bang…”
A gunshot sounded as the badly beaten man’s head was shot in the head by Ingelund and died on the spot.
Hopelessness and despair filled the hearts of the other nine civilians upon hearing Ingelund’s words. They knew they were as good as dead. This place was a battlefield and not under the rule and law of the society. In this hellish place, a human could die at anytime.
Hiding amid the thicket, Tang Xiu’s eyelids slanted after hearing it, the murderous intent inside him getting thicker. He just identified Ingelund. It was the man who shot and killed the Bloodfish Pirates’ leader—Duffsky, the second leader of the Bloodfish Pirates… Ingelund.
_‘This bastard is ruthless and merciless; he must be the first one to be killed. The other pirate members will collapse at once without their leaders. However, the problem is the remaining nine civilians over there.’_
Tang Xiu thought for a moment and faintly felt that the situation was somewhat tricky.


Under the dark night’s obscure moonlight, Tang Xiu quietly left as though a ghost and soon appeared at a dark secluded thicket. He took out a satellite phone and then called Wolf Head.
“The pirates are using hostages to threaten us. How can we get rid of all the pirates while ensuring the safety of the hostages?” Tang Xiu whispered.
“It’s very difficult to achieve, unless we wait and retreat.”
“Wait and retreat?” Tang Xiu was somewhat puzzled.
“As long as they are on the island and holding the captives, we can achieve nothing if we want to kill them as well as ensure the safety of the hostages. Unless they board the ship and set sail, only then can we sneak into their ship and assassinate them,” said Wolf Head.
“What you proposed is also a solution. But if they board the ship, it will be very hard for us to slip into the ship to assassinate them without us being spotted. Also, we gotta decimate the second leader of this Bloodfish Pirates as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will still have a backbone, greatly increasing the difficulty for us to assassinate them,” said Tang Xiu.
Wolf Head was silent for several seconds before he then slowly said, “Then, I’ll assassinate this Ingelund.”
“No. It’s very easy for me to kill him, but I fear those hostages will be killed if I rashly kill him,” said Tang Xiu.
“I have observed the remaining pirates. They have a total 61 people left now. If all of us were to coordinate and ambush them in a strategic terrain, shooting at them in a close distance, we should be able to kill more than half of their numbers. Also, we need to assign four of our people to stay on guard to especially observe those pirates. whoever amongst them shoots the hostages in the forefront, they must kill them in advance. However, I can’t guarantee that all the hostages will survive, though,” said Wolf Head.
Tang Xiu silently analyzed Wolf Head’s proposal in his mind. If he let those pirates leave, the remaining nine hostages would highly likely be killed. But if he carried on the killing and rescue on Nine Dragon Island, some of the hostages would probably die.
After measuring and weighing the whole situation, Tang Xiu made up his mind and said in a heavy voice, “We’ll do it according to your suggestion. Killing these pirates is a risky and dangerous act in itself and dying is but also a possibility. We’ll do our best even if those hostages are in a dangerous situations.”
After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu watched the pirates’ advancing direction. He circled from the flank as though a fast wind or a electrical spark. After four to five minutes, he approached Wolf Head and the others’ hiding place.
"Have you informed Awen and Awu?” Tang Xiu took the binoculars handed by his man and whispered.
“They have been informed and should be here soon,” said Wolf Head.
Nodding in reply, Tang Xiu then used the binoculars to observe, finding that the pirates were holding the remaining nine hostages and walking toward this direction. At this time, they looked frightened and constantly moved their guns’ muzzles around.

“Boss, considering their speed, it should take about four minutes for them to arrive at our position. Are you thinking to make this spot as an ambush point?” asked Wolf Head in a whisper.
Looking at the surrounding, Tang Xiu assented with a nod, “Yes. Though we are in a disadvantageous position because of the inclination, our tracks are completely concealed. Unless they climb the boulders on both sides, they won’t be able find us. Also, we mustn’t open fire before they’ve arrived and we can’t accidentally hurt the hostages in the forefront. Hence, we must wait until they passed, shooting them in the back.”
“Boss, I think it’s not quite right. We should put a few people here while the rest circle to the back. But the four men staying here, their main purpose is to monitor those pirates who are very close to the hostages and can freely kill them. If they find that their muzzles are aimed at the hostages, they will shoot them immediately,” said Wolf Head.
“OK!” After thinking, Tang Xiu directly approved it.
He didn’t have knowledge about military tactics and devising battle plans. But Wolf Head was once the top ace of the country’s special forces and had undertaken numerous missions and devised numerous battle plans by himself. Thus, his opinion was worth employing.
Shortly after, the Mo brothers also quickly arrived and approved with a nod upon hearing Wolf Head’s idea.
“Awen, Awu; both of you, along with Wolf Head and Wang Ming, will team up. Your main purpose is to kill those pirates who are close to the hostages. I will kill Ingelund first while the rest will slay the other pirates as fast as you can. We must be fast, ruthless and accurate. If any pirates escape, you don’t need to chase them down, kill most of the pirates first instead,” said Tang Xiu.
"No problem!" Everyone nodded.
Time flew by.
Quickly, those pirates holding the hostages were about a hundred meters away from Awen, Awu, and the others’ ambush point. Behind them were Tang Xiu with five of his men, following along quietly. The distance was only 40-50 meters away from the pirates in the forefront.
“Keep yourselves concealed and approach them as close as you can,” Tang Xiu ordered in a whisper.
A minute after, Tang Xiu climbed up a big tree and looked through the branches and leaves. The pirates were about 20-30 meters away as his vision swept at them and then finally locked on Ingelund, aiming his muzzle at him.
“Bang…”
A gunshot was sound as a bloody hole was created on the back of Ingelund’s head. His eyes stared wide as he turned his head with difficulty to look at Tang Xiu’s direction. His vision turned blurred as he lost his consciousness and died on the spot.
"Bang, bang, bang..."
“Rat-tat-tat…”
Intense gunfire broke out as tongues of flames burst in and out.
Bullets poured out as though raindrops, aiming toward the pirates, while submachine guns’ shots also barked from both sides of the pirates.
“RUUUN! AAAAH!”
A pirate who was scared to death screamed sharply as he snowballed himself to avoid the bullets fired into the nearby thicket. Unfortunately, bad luck befell unto him as a bullet made a hole on his head and he finally dropped down on the thick patches of grass, motionless.
Of the more than 60 pirates, except for those who were shot dead, all fled to every direction. They didn’t have the capacity and reaction a regular army possessed, neither they possessed the loftiness to be valiant and fearless. They were pirates, hoodlums, and thugs who would even betray their souls for money and benefits. When they were powerful, they would ruthlessly bully and massacre others, but in the face of more powerful and vicious enemies, they would fall into fear and run away.
After half a minute, except for dead bodies everywhere, only seven or eight pirates who were lucky enough to quickly flee into the bushes by the side of the road were left. The rest all died a horrible death. But four among the nine hostages were shot and killed during the counterattack of the pirates, along with two injured.
Tang Xiu strode into the middle of the dead bodies and released his spiritual sense to cover the area.
“Bang, bang…”
As his fingers pulled the trigger, he directly shot and killed four or five severely wounded pirates who were not directly killed and pretending to be dead.
Retracting his spiritual sense, Tang Xiu looked at the frightened hostages on the ground and asked in a deep voice, “Tell me who you are!”
A white-haired Caucasian man with an injured leg who sat slumped on the ground answered, “We are the residents of the Southern Bird Island who got caught and held captives by them! Who are you guys?”
“I’m the owner of this island,” said Tang Xiu.
“You lie. The owner of this island is James—James Bond. I once helped him construct the buildings here. He’s a good rich man,” said the Caucasian man whilst shaking his head.
“Don’t tell me you don’t know that he’s sold this island? I’m the one who bought this island! Do remember later, my Chinese name is Tang Xiu and I’m the owner of this place,” said Tang Xiu lightly.
The man gulped down his saliva and said in a bit of awe, “I’ll remember your name.”
Tang Xiu nodded and then said to Wolf Head and his men around, “Two of you stay here and dress up their wounds. The rest will chase down and kill the rest of the pirates. Do remember to kill them completely or as many as possible. If they run too fast and you can’t find them, then let them be. In short, I don’t want any pirates on Nine Dragon Island before dawn.”
“Roger that, Boss!”
Wolf Head motioned two men as the rest then ran toward the forested hills around. But Mo Awen and Mo Awu entered the woods to chase down the pirates.
Then, Tang Xiu looked at the Southern Bird Island’s residents and calmly said, “You don’t have to be afraid. I’m the owner of this place and not one of these vicious pirates. Not only will I guarantee your safety, I’ll also ensure your safe departure of this island. For now, I’ll have to trouble you to return to the castle with us. Then I’ll send some people to escort you back to Southern Bird Island after you have a good rest tomorrow.”
“Thank you. Thank you very much!”
Upon hearing it, the five people immediately looked ecstatic.
****
Inside the castle, over a hundred residents from Southern Bird Island were tied and locked up in a spacious hall. Each and every one of them had panicked expressions on their faces and were desperately struggling. Of the more than 100 of them, only six were men and the rest were women, mostly pretty young women.
These women, many of them wore clothes that were unable to cover their figures and apparently had received severe abuse.
“Mayor Oshima, you gotta find a solution fast. If we can’t escape, we’ll all die here!” With panic filling her eyes, a slightly fat woman quickly spoke with a tone of anxiousness and restlessness.
In front of her was the mayor of Southern Bird Island, Kawasaki Oshima.
Southern Bird Island originally had a small area, and the highest point on the ground didn’t even exceed ten meters above the sea level. However, due to the earthquake a few years ago, leading to the increase of the surface level of the Southern Bird Island, the area also increased two or three times. From thereon, many immigrants had set up their home on this island.
The entire Southern Bird Island only had a small town with a total population of no more than 1,000 people. Because Kawasaki Oshima had a high status there, everyone voted him as the mayor. In actuality, he was a mayor under the jurisdiction of the Japan government. After all, several thousand kilometers around the Southern Bird Island and dozens of islands there were under Japan’s jurisdiction.
He was already over his 40s and it didn’t betray Kawasaki Oshima’s old state. He desperately struggled in an attempt to break the ropes on his body, but his futile efforts amounted to nothing. Those pirates’ skill in tying up and binding were truly excellent. He worked hard for half an hour, yet there was no sign of it loosening.


Time passed by and the over hundred people in the hall were getting more desperate. Except for a few who knew the existence of Nine Dragon Island, the rest had never even heard of this place. Such foreign environment, brutal pirates and, coupled with the burst of gunfire sounding from time to time, it were as though a Taoist voodoo spell was hastening them to their deaths and scaring them.
In the corner, Yi Lianyan had already severed the rope that tied her hands behind her back. However, she didn’t get up yet and even pushed her back to the corner and maintained the same posture. But her hand tightly held a folding fruit knife.
She loved the ocean and used her summer vacation from Shanghai to visit the Southern Bird Island. Savoring the taste of the customs and visiting the beautiful environment there, even the only hotel where she stayed was facing the ocean. It was as though a warm spring with blooming flowers everywhere.
Unfortunately, after having stayed in Southern Bird Island for more than half a month, when she was about to go to the other islands near Southern Bird Island, the pirates that had snuck into the island began their plunder. Thanks to her life in Sichuan Opera family who possessed magical changing appearance techniques for generations, hence, she hastily used the cosmetics she brought to change her appearance when the pirates weren’t paying attention to her.
She actually possessed a beautiful face, but as the result of her efforts, she looked extremely ugly. It was precisely because of this that she was lucky enough to escape the abuses and ravages of those pirates and was locked up with a few others.
“Everyone please think of a solution! We can escape even if only one person has untied his or her rope,” Kawasaki Oshima was restless as he sweated profusely.
After half a minute, nobody responded. No one got up.
Yi Lianyan’s expression constantly changed. She didn’t know whether there were still pirates outside. Were they still there and learned she was the first to untie her rope, they would probably kill her.
_‘What should I do?’_
Inside her innermost heart, a fierce battle commenced, causing her expression to constantly change.
_‘I gotta go ahead regardless. Even if there’s only a slim chance of survival, I must get a hold of it. It’s better to act rather than resign myself to death and do nothing.’_ A determined expression finally appeared on Yi Lianyan’s eyes as she removed the ropes from her body and suddenly stood.
“Bang…”
The muffled sound of a gunshot sounded.
Yi Lianyan’s face greatly changed. She instantly judged that someone had just shot the lock on the hall’s door. Almost in a flash, she squatted on the floor, scrambling to grab the ropes and casually wrapped it back around her body.
In the next moment, the hall’s door was trampled open as several men in casual attire with submachine guns rushed into the hall. Upon seeing the situation inside, they instantly aimed their muzzles at the people inside.

“The hostages are here, Boss!” A man turned his head and shouted toward the outside.
Tang Xiu’s figure appeared at the door as his eyes swept toward the crowd in the hall with anger suffused in his eyes. The vast majority of these hostages were women, most of whom were in a very pitiful and embarrassing state and had apparently been raped and ravaged.
In the corner, Yi Lianyan’s eyes instantly stared wide-eyed with an ecstatic expression in her eyes. The big man who just spoke was neither using English or Japanese. It was pure Mandarin.
_‘Mandarin? Are they from China?’_
Her breathing turned faster. After firming her heart, she immediately stood and shouted, “Hey, I’m Chinese, and you are?”
Tang Xiu was stunned, looking at Yi Lianyan’s extremely ugly changed face and found that her clothes were still intact with only some scratches on her face. He immediately approached her and said, “Yes, we’re Chinese. I didn’t expect that these pirates also had kidnapped one of our fellow countrymen. What’s your name?”
“Yi Lianyan!”
“How did you get caught?” asked Tang Xiu.
“I was visiting this place, making use of my summer vacation after the CET. I eventually got captured and was transported with them here,” said Yi Lianyan.
Tang Xiu shook his head and sighed, “You luck is not good, but it’s not bad either. Congratulations. You’re free now.”
Several men with submachine guns put their muzzles down and began to untie the hostages. After everyone stood, Kawasaki Oshima came before Tang Xiu with a face full of excitement and then respectfully said, “Hello, I’m Kawasaki Oshima. Thank you for saving us. You’re our savior and liberator, we will remember you.”
Tang Xiu knitted his brows and asked lightly, “You’re all Japanese?”
“Yes!” said Kawasaki Oshima.
“Take a rest first then! I’ll send some people to escort you back after dawn. Also, I hope you won’t spread what happened here,” said Tang Xiu.
“Dear Sir, we must try our best to publicize this act of kindness. After all, you drove away those pirates and you’re also our hero. It is only right if everyone all over the world knows your heroic deeds,” said Kawasaki Oshima.
Tang Xiu indifferently looked at him and said lightly, “We are no heroes nor was it necessary for us to save you. It’s just that I have bought this island, whereas those pirates happened to be occupying it, so it was necessary for us to drive them away. Hence, rescuing you was just a passing incident. Not to mention that once the matters here were to spread out, it would only bring us a lot of troubles.”
The over hundred rescued people looked at each other. They didn’t understand what Tang Xiu was saying. However, Tang Xiu was the one who rescued their lives, they didn’t want to bring trouble for him. Hence, they promised not to disclose anything that happened in this place.
Certainly, the majority of them were women, to begin with. So they were naturally very satisfied with Tang Xiu’s request to keep the matter confidential. After all, they were just violated by the pirates, which was severely detrimental to their reputations.
Tang Xiu then said in a deep voice, “Anyhow, it is not particularly safe outside, though. Some pirates have escaped and I can’t guarantee they won’t be back sneaking here again to avenge their comrades. Thus, you have to stay here until we make sure that all the remaining pirates have left.”
“Alright…”
“Thank you…”
"..."
Tang Xiu shook his head and was ready to leave as Yi Lianyan quickly rushed over and grabbed his arm. She then shook her head and said, “I don’t want to stay here. Can I go with you?”
“You are the only Chinese here?” asked Tang Xiu after a moment’s hesitation.
“There’s only me,” said Yi Lianyan with a nod.
“Come then! Hopefully the scene outside won’t scare you off too much,” said Tang Xiu.
After leaving the hall, Tang Xiu then said to several of his men who just came out, “Pile up all the dead bodies and then wait for Wolf Head and the others to come back.”
“Yes!” the several men immediately dispersed upon hearing it.
Half an hour later, Wolf Head, the Mo brothers, and the others arrived back and brought along six dead bodies. After throwing the corpses at the square outside the castle, Wolf Head respectfully said, “Boss, we only caught six, a few of them have escaped. After we caught up to them, we found that those several pirates had been long gone by ship.”
Tang Xiu nodded, “Since they have escaped, just count it as their good luck. Anyways, pile up all the corpses! After burning them, we’ll clean up the castle.”
“Yes!” Wolf Head respectfully replied.
Tang Xiu then looked to Mo Awen and said, “After dawn, take some men and escort those civilian captives to Southern Bird Island. After you got there, warn them to keep it all confidential.”
“Understood!” Mo Awen replied with a nod.
After the fierce and intense night battle, only a few of the more than 200 pirates escaped as all others were killed here, making Tang Xiu rather satisfied with the victory. None of his men died and only a few were injured.
However, the damage to the castle was not small due to the gun battle. However, since Tang Xiu had planned to rebuild the place, he didn’t seriously mind it. With Mo Awu accompanying him, he visited the entire castle and strolled around for several hours before returning to the square outside the castle with satisfaction.
Yi Lianyan, who had been following Tang Xiu, tried to ask him questions many times, yet, seeing as how Tang Xiu was full of enthusiasm, she repressed her questions inside.
At this moment, she finally couldn’t help asking, “Big Brother Tang, did you really buy this island?”
“Yup,” Tang Xiu laughed.
Once again, she asked, “Who are you really? What are you gonna do with such an isolated island? To my knowledge, it would perhaps take 24 hours to sail from here to Southern Bird Island. Also, this place is very difficult to find if you have no precise sea route navigation.”
“Have you read Tao Yuanming’s Peach Blossom Spring?” Tang Xiu laughed.
Yi Lianyan’s eyes stared wide, astounded, “I have. It’s the lore in the textbooks of junior high school. You mean… you want to build a paradise here?”
“Yup. I want to build a paradise here,” Tang Xiu laughed.
Yi Lianyan’s mouth twitched a few times as she said with a strange expression, "Rich men such as you have very particular hobbies. But how would your men be so powerful? They killed those ferocious pirates without batting an eye. Also, those pirates had more than 200 people, yet only a few of them escaped, while the rest were all killed by you and your men. Isn’t this rather too much?”
Tang Xiu smiled faintly, “I don’t want to answer this question. But I can give you some words for free, though.”
“What words?” asked Yi Lianyan, puzzled.
Letting out a smile that was yet unlike one, Tang Xiu said, “A genuinely smart person is someone who knows how to feign ignorance. But someone who knows nothing yet wants to know the bottom of the matter would be just like the saying -- ‘curiosity killed the cat’.”
Yi Lianyan was stupefied for a moment as she then instantly lowered her head and fell into silence.
Letting out a faint smile, Tang Xiu then turned to Wolf Head and said, “I give you ten days to investigate the whole Nine Dragon Island. I must make sure that nobody except us are in this place. Besides, I’ll also draw architectural designs and decide the construction company that will cooperate with me before I return to the mainland.”
“Boss, I think the constructions here are rather fine! Why do you want to rebuild it?” said Wolf Head.
